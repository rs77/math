    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "To inverse a function simply swap the $x$ and $y$ values around in the original function. Then rearrange the original function with the newly swapped $x$ and $y$ value to make $y$ the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Not *every* function can be transformed into its inverse type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse functions need to satisfy the **horizontal rule test** which is simply a one-to-one relationship between the $x$ and $y$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple quadratic equation $y = x^2$ cannot be readily transformed into an inverse function as it **fails** the horizontal rule test. Why? When $x = 1, y = 1$ and when $x = -1, y = 1$ even though we have two distinct $x$ values, they give the **same** $y$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circumventing the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this issue we can truncate the domain of $x$ values to restrict the function so that it *can* satisfy the horizontal rule test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can achieve the inverse function of $y = x^2$ by restricting the domain of this function to $0 \\leq x \\leq \\infty \\\\, \\text{(or as an interval: $[0, \\infty)$)}$ "
