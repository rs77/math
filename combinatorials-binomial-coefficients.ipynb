    "## Binomial Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The *binomial coefficient* is commonly annotated in several different formats in mathematics, here are these ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{}^nC_r = \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose $r$ items from $n$ items **without considering order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are 8 boys and 5 need to be chosen for a basketball team, how many different teams can be made?\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be calculated as follows using the binomial expressions above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{}^nC_r &= \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\\\ \n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 &= \\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 &= \\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5!\\ 3!} \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 &= 56\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $56$ different teams of $5$ that can be made up from a selection of $8$ boys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of choices of the UN-chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "What would the formula be if we wanted to find the number of different combinations for 3 boys who were **not** chosen for the basketball team?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of finding the answer for ${}^8C_5$ we instead would find the answer of the following: ${}^nC_{n - r} = {}^8C_{8 - 5} = {}^8C_{3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What answer do you get when you enter this into your calculator?\n",
    "\n",
    "$${}^8C_3 = 56$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting, isn't it? Why would we get the same answer as the $5$ boys chosen?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we just observed the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\binom{n}{r} = \\binom{n}{n - r} \\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 = {}^8C_3\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can prove this by performing the following proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\binom{n}{r} &= \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} && \\text{standard binomial formula} \\\\[5pt]\n",

    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A class of 11 students is having an all out scissors-paper-rock brawl. Each student claims to have played with 5 different people. Prove that someone is not telling the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "If each of the 11 students claimed to played with 5 others, this would amount to $11 \\times 5 = 55$ games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this sum **double-counts** every game because if student $A$ plays with student $B$, it is counted once in $A$'s total and once in $B$'s total. Thus the actual number of distinct games is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{11 \\times 5}{2} = 27.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of distinct games must be an integer because games are actual physical events - there can't be a fractional number of games (unless students were halfway through a game when the teacher asked the question!).\n",
    "\n",
    "As $27.5$ is not an integer the claim made that each student played $5$ games cannot be true.\n",
