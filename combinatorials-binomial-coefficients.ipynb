    "# Permutations & Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutations are a counting method to find the number of different ordered selections of $r$ objects from $n$ objects. The objects selected are arranged **without replacement**, and not *all* objects need to be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutations are represented in mathematics as: ${}^nP_r$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, written as a formula, permutations are calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If **all** objects are to be selected we would arrive at ${}^nP_n = n!$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is why when calculating $0!$ mathematicians like $0! = 1$. Here's one reason why using the permutations formula above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{}^nP_n &= \\frac{n!}{(n - n)!} && \\text{substitute $r = n$} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "&= \\frac{n!}{0!} && \\text{simplify denominator - notice $0!$} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "&= \\frac{n!}{1} && \\text{simplify $0! = 1$ to achieve answer} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "&= n! && \\text{answer} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know if all objects are to be used this answer needs to $n!$, therefore we cannot have $\\infty$ as the answer, hence why ${}^nP_n = n!$ and $0! = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "13 cards are chosen at random from 20 cards without replacement. Find the possible number of ways the cards can be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The first card chosen would be any of the 20 cards available. The second card would be any of the 19 cards remaining. The third card can be any of the 18 cards available, etc etc... The thirteenth card would be any of the 8 cards remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the number of ways the cards can be chosen $= 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times ... \\times 8 = 4.8 \\times 10^{14}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, in the calculator ${}^nP_r = {}^{20}P_13 = 4.8 \\times 10^{14}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinations are another counting method to help us calculate the number of different options are available when order is **not important**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinations are represented in mathematics as: ${}^nC_r$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or as a formula: $\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binomial Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The *binomial coefficient* is commonly annotated in several different formats in mathematics, here are these ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{}^nC_r = \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial coefficient represents the number of ways to choose $r$ items from $n$ items **without considering order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are 8 boys and 5 need to be chosen for a basketball team, how many different teams can be made?\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be calculated as follows using the binomial expressions above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "{}^nC_r &= \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\\\ \n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 &= \\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 &= \\binom{8}{5} = \\frac{8!}{5!\\ 3!} \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 &= 56\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $56$ different teams of $5$ that can be made up from a selection of $8$ boys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Number of choices of the UN-chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "What would the formula be if we wanted to find the number of different combinations for 3 boys who were **not** chosen for the basketball team?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of finding the answer for ${}^8C_5$ we instead would find the answer of the following: ${}^nC_{n - r} = {}^8C_{8 - 5} = {}^8C_{3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What answer do you get when you enter this into your calculator?\n",
    "\n",
    "$${}^8C_3 = 56$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting, isn't it? Why would we get the same answer as the $5$ boys chosen?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we just observed the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\binom{n}{r} = \\binom{n}{n - r} \\\\\n",
    "{}^8C_5 = {}^8C_3\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can prove this by performing the following proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\binom{n}{r} &= \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} && \\text{standard binomial formula} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "\\binom{n}{r} &= \\binom{n}{n - r} && \\text{test to prove} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "\\binom{n}{n - r} &= \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!(n - (n - r))!} && \\text{substitute $n - r$ for $r$ in standard formula} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "\\binom{n}{n - r} &= \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!(n - n + r)!} && \\text{expand brackets} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "\\binom{n}{n - r} &= \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!(\\cancel{n} - \\cancel{n} + r)!} && \\text{cancel $n$ in denominator} \\\\[5pt]\n",
    "\\binom{n}{n - r} &= \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!\\ r!} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} && \\text{rearrange denominator products} \\\\[5pt]\n",

    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A class of 11 students is having an all out scissors-paper-rock brawl. Each student claims to have played with 5 different people. Prove that someone is not telling the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "If each of the 11 students claimed to played with 5 others, this would amount to $11 \\times 5 = 55$ games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this sum **double-counts** every game because if student $A$ plays with student $B$, it is counted once in $A$'s total and once in $B$'s total. Thus the actual number of distinct games is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{11 \\times 5}{2} = 27.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of distinct games must be an integer because games are actual physical events - there can't be a fractional number of games (unless students were halfway through a game when the teacher asked the question!).\n",
    "\n",
    "As $27.5$ is not an integer the claim made that each student played $5$ games cannot be true.\n",
