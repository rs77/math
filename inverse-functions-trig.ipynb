    "To inverse a function simply swap the $x$ and $y$ values around in the original function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the original function were $y = 2x^2 - 4$ to create an inverse function we would perform the following and then make $y$ the subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "y &= 2x^2 - 4 &&\\text{original function} \\\\\n",
    "x &= 2y^2 - 4 &&\\text{swap $x$ and $y$ in the original function} \\\\\n",
    "x + 4 &= 2y^2 \\cancel{- 4 + 4} &&\\text{$+ \\ 4$ both sides} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{x + 4}{2} &= \\frac{\\cancel{2}y^2}{\\cancel{2}} &&\\text{$\\div \\ 2$ both sides} \\\\\n",

    "Both of these are the same expression, therefore, $\\tan^{-1}{x} = \\arctan{x}$ (and the same for $\\sin^{-1} = \\arcsin{x}$ and $\\cos^{-1} = \\arccos{x}$)\n",
